                        <h3>A little background</h3>
                        <p>The above picture reminds me of my journey from transitioning from primary school to higher levels of education. I was a dedicated young girl who had big dreams. Some dreams I thought would never come through, but now I can see every bit of them coming to life. With the love of Mathematics and numbers from a young age, I never knew that one day I would start building a career from my passion. Now Machine learning, specifically Deep Learning, is what I look forward to specializing in. Diving into the world of creating algorithms and ML models.</p>

                        <h3>Aspirations and Impact</h3>
                        <p>Now I am a strong advocate for women in STEM fields. I believe that no child should be left behind. African society should stop the perspective that Mathematics is for male students only nor Science.</p>

                        <p>University life - I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at the African Leadership University. I look forward to graduating in September 2026 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.</p>
